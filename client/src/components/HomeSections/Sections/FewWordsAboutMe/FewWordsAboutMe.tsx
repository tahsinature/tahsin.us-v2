        I'm a Jakarta based Software Engineer. A passionate and pragmatic programmer with {moment.duration(moment().diff(moment().set('year', 2018).startOf('year'))).humanize()} of professional
        experience, specializing in microservices & full-stack development using modern & robust technologies. Sometimes I work on things I find interesting, or things I think other people might find
        interesting. Itâ€™s nice when those things overlap.
